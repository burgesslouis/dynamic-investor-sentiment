# dynamic-investor-sentiment
Indices from Burgess, Chen, and Zhang (2023), "A dynamic model of investor sentiment".

We propose a dynamic measure of market sentiment, extending Baker and Wurgler
(2006)â€™s index on the basis that aggregate sentiment must cover a wide range of investors
or investment activities; such aggregation must adapt to changes in how different sen-
timent indicators reflecting sentiment; and the aggregation must not be informed by
future information. We demonstrate that each basis has a specific impact. Ignoring
these points when constructing models of sentiment can cause empirical effects to be
over- or under-estimated and constrain the usability of the modelled sentiment in prac-
tical applications. We test our index against fourteen anomaly portfolio returns and
confirm the classic sentiment-induced mispricing effect on short or hard-to-value legs,
while observing increasing sentiment-induced mispricing on the long or easier-to-value
legs post-2000.
